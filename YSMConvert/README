YSM Convert Project.
++++++++++++++++++++

The idea of YSMConvert is to create an amount of scripts
to allow users with other ICQ Clients to convert their contacts
database to YSM in a fast and easy way.

Using these scripts, you may dump to stdout a parsed and organized
output of your icq contacts, that is, a list compatible with Ysm.
Just paste that output in your YSM Config file, below the [SLAVES]
line.


* Trillian to Ysm * [ by GasFed ]
--------------------

Convert your trillian contact list into ysm format!
Usage: cat Buddies.xml | perl trillian2ysm.pl

* CenterICQ to Ysm * [ by SToRM NiGHT <storm@malditainternet.com> ]
---------------------

Now CENTERICQ users can translate their contact lists into 
YSM format using this brand new wonderful perl script.
Just run "centericq.pl" and it will look for your $HOME/.centericq/
directory and print the results to stdout.

* Licq to Ysm *	[ by A. David Weil - aweil@mail.ru - ]
---------------

Now YSM users have the chance to transform their LICQ
contact lists to YSM format so they can easily append 
the output of licq2Ysm to their YSM config files!.

Just run licq2Ysm with the same user who's got the .licq
directory in his home directory.

Use: ./licq2Ysm

the default output file is named: "APPEND-IT-TO-YSM-Config"


* clb to Ysm *	[ by A. David Weil - aweil@mail.ru - ]
---------------          

Mirabilis(r) ICQ Client 2001 and + for Windows generates a file
with an extension ".clb" that contains a backup of your contact
list. Using the "clb2Ysm.sh" script, you can generate an Ysm 
compatible slaves list.

Use: ./clib2Ysm.sh file.clb > dumpfile
